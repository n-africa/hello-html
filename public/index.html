      For this assignment, we are asked to write about our passion. There was a
      point in my life that my passion was to be on stage or in a movie. I went
      to Rutgers University over almost 10 years ago and my major was theater. I
      did not want to go to college, I felt it was a waste of time because in
      order to make it in ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù, you didn‚Äôt need a degree, you needed
      opportunity. Having connections and taking certain acting classes or
      programs, is valued way more than having a degree.
    </p>

      My father forced me to go to college and then forced me to change my major
      from Theater. I sit here, 10 years later, with college loan debt, from
      what I felt was a legitimate waste of my time. I knew what I didn‚Äôt want
      and for some reason all the adults in my life refused to listen. I didn‚Äôt
      complete the degree, dropping out at only 48 credits and the last
      semester, I stopped going to class.

      Fast forward to now, I have spent most of my 20‚Äôs, in some customer
      service jobs, as a laboratory technician and spent a couple of years at
      the post office, where I met my wife. Most of that time was spent on
      dreaming about getting out there on the stage or screen, but never
      actually doing it. I say this now because my passion has changed. I want
      to make a good life for myself. I want to be happy and I want to be able
      to be comfortable. The technology field is one of only 3 fields that are
      always changing, evolving and is always in demand. When I saw this, I know
      this is where I needed to be. I inspire myself everyday by researching
      exactly how life will be after this program. I have spent all of my adult
      life being a number amongst employees. Companies treating you like you can
      be thrown away, replaceable, because I was. Learning these skills, helps
      improve my value, and that is what I want out of life, to be
      <i>valuable</i>.
